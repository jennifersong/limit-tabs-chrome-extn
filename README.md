limit-tabs-chrome-extn
======================
A Chrome extension that limits the number of tabs you have open in your browser. If you try to open a tab when you are at the maximum number of tabs allowed, you will be unable to open any new tabs until you have lowered the number of tabs you have. The default limit is 20, but you can modify this number in the extension's options.

To install, go to chrome://extensions, check "Developer mode", and click "Load unpacked extension", and then select the root directory of this extension.
